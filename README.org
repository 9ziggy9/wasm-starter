* WASM starter
This is an absolute bare bones starter to get wasm up and running locally. Quite painful that an HTTP server is even needed to bootstrap web assembly, but it is what it is.
*** Why index.html?
Because you need index.html to bootstrap Javascript...
*** Why index.js?
Because you need index.js to bootstrap WebAssembly...
*** Why the shell script?
Because you need fetch to instantiate WebAssembly... And otherwise you're going to get a CORS error. Shell script just runs python3 simple http server. Don't forget to mark run as executable.
*** Why not pipenv or virtual environment?
I don't even want to use python, but everyone has simple http--why would I use flask/django or express or something like this?
